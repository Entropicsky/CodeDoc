## CodeDoc Testing Plan

### Testing Components

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock dependencies to isolate behavior
   - Focus on correctness of implementation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test combined components
   - Test flows between components
   - Verify interfaces work together

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test full pipeline flow
   - Test with realistic examples
   - Focus on user experience

### Test Coverage Requirements

- All public methods and classes should have unit tests
- All major user workflows should have integration tests
- Critical behaviors should have end-to-end tests

### Testing Environment

- Use pytest as testing framework
- Use unittest.mock for mocking
- Use tempfile for file operations in tests
- Use fixtures for test isolation

### Mocking Strategies

1. **LLM API Calls**
   - Mock OpenAI's client at the class method level using `patch.object()`
   - Set up return values that match the structure the code expects
   - Ensure usage stats are included in mock returns
   
2. **File Operations**
   - Use tempfile and tmp_path fixtures to create temporary test files
   - Create realistic test data for file operations
   - Clean up files after tests

3. **Pipeline Component Mocking**
   - Mock component classes at the method level they're called
   - Ensure mock return values match expected structure 
   - Test components individually before testing them together

4. **Best Practices for Mocking**
   - Mock at the closest level to where the external dependency is used
   - Always verify that mocks were called as expected
   - Use realistic mock return values to avoid structural issues
   - Be aware of what methods and attributes are accessed on mock objects

### Test Categories

1. **Preprocessor Tests**
   - Test chunking strategies
   - Test file processing
   - Test content filtering

2. **Enhancer Tests**
   - Test file enhancement
   - Test content generation
   - Test code analysis

3. **Vector Store Tests**
   - Test embedding generation
   - Test vector storage
   - Test vector search

4. **Pipeline Tests**
   - Test end-to-end workflows
   - Test error handling
   - Test configuration options

### Debugging Strategies

1. **Log Analysis**
   - Use pytest's log capture to analyze logs
   - Look for error patterns in logs
   - Use log levels to filter information

2. **Mock Verification**
   - Verify mock calls to ensure they're called as expected
   - Check arguments passed to mocks
   - Inspect return values

3. **Test Isolation**
   - Run individual tests with -v flag
   - Use pytest.mark to categorize tests
   - Debug tests in isolation before running full suite

### Continuous Integration

- Run tests on every commit
- Generate coverage reports
- Block merges with failing tests

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Mock Structure Mismatches**
   - Ensure mock return values match the structure expected by code
   - Add debug print statements to compare expected vs. actual values
   - Use type hints to document expected structures

2. **Path Issues in Tests**
   - Use Path objects consistently for better cross-platform support
   - Be careful with absolute vs. relative paths
   - Use temporary paths for tests

3. **API Response Simulation**
   - Ensure mocked API responses include all required fields
   - Include response metadata like tokens used
   - Test error conditions as well as success

4. **Integration Test Complexity**
   - Break complex integration tests into smaller focused tests
   - Test individual stages before testing full pipeline
   - Use fixtures to share setup between tests

### Test Documentation

- Document test requirements
- Document test fixtures
- Include examples of expected inputs/outputs 

## Integration Testing Updates

### Rally-Here Codebase Testing

We've made significant progress in testing the integration with the rally-here codebase. Here are the key learnings and improvements:

1. **Simplified Testing Approach**: 
   - Break down complex tests into simpler, targeted tests
   - Focus on testing one component/functionality at a time
   - Build up to full integration tests once individual components work

2. **Mocking Improvements**:
   - Mock at the method level rather than class level for precision
   - Use `patch.object()` for specific method mocking
   - Ensure mock returns match expected structure exactly, including metadata
   - Verify that mocks are called with the expected arguments

3. **Path Forward**:
   - Continue using incremental approach for all integration tests
   - Document expected input/output structures for all components
   - Create test utilities for common mocking patterns
   - Enhance logging to make test failures easier to diagnose

### Testing Organization

For all future integration tests, we'll follow this approach:

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Create component-specific mocks with correct return structures
   - Set up temporary directories for test outputs
   - Initialize pipeline with appropriate configuration
   - Configure logging to capture useful debug information

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - Test each pipeline component individually first
   - Combine components incrementally
   - Use small subsets of files for testing (3-5 files)
   - Set clear expectations for each component's output

3. **Verification Phase**:
   - Verify mocks were called with expected arguments
   - Check that output directories contain expected files
   - Validate result structure matches expectations
   - Ensure error handling works as expected

4. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - Remove temporary directories/files
   - Reset any modified configuration
   - Clean up mock objects

This structured approach will help ensure our tests are reliable, maintainable, and effective at catching issues.
