# CodeDoc Testing Summary

## Test Coverage Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive test suite for the CodeDoc project, providing both unit tests for individual components and integration tests for complete workflows. The test suite covers all the major components:

1. **LLM Clients**
   - Tests for base LLM client interfaces
   - Tests for OpenAI client implementation
   - Mock components for testing without actual API calls

2. **Prompt Templates**
   - Tests for prompt template loading
   - Tests for template rendering
   - Tests for system and user prompt separation

3. **Chunking Strategies**
   - Tests for fixed-size chunking
   - Tests for paragraph-based chunking
   - Tests for semantic chunking
   - Tests for code-block chunking
   - Tests for token estimation

4. **Metadata Generation**
   - Tests for basic metadata extraction
   - Tests for language-specific metadata extraction
   - Tests for Python, JavaScript, and Markdown files

5. **File Processing**
   - Tests for processing individual files
   - Tests for processing directories
   - Tests for generating batch files for vector stores
   - Tests for handling file exclusions

6. **Vector Store Integration**
   - Tests for OpenAI vector store client
   - Tests for file management operations
   - Tests for search functionality
   - Mock implementations to avoid actual API calls

7. **Content Generation**
   - Tests for FAQ generation
   - Tests for tutorial generation
   - Tests for architecture diagram generation
   - Tests for error handling

8. **Main Pipeline**
   - Tests for pipeline initialization
   - Tests for each pipeline stage
   - Tests for end-to-end execution
   - Tests for configuration options

9. **Integration Tests**
   - Tests for enhance-and-process workflow
   - Tests for process-and-search workflow
   - Tests for the complete pipeline

## Test Organization

The tests are organized in a mirrored directory structure to the main codebase:

```
codedoc/tests/
├── llm/                    # Tests for LLM clients
├── enhancers/              # Tests for enhancers
├── preprocessors/          # Tests for preprocessors
├── vectorstore/            # Tests for vector store integration
├── integration/            # Integration tests
├── conftest.py             # Shared fixtures and utilities
└── test_pipeline.py        # Tests for the main pipeline
```

## Test Configuration

We use pytest as the primary testing framework with the following configuration:

- **Markers**: Unit tests are the default, integration tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`
- **Fixtures**: Shared fixtures in `conftest.py` for common test resources
- **Mocks**: Extensive use of unittest.mock for external dependencies
- **Parameterization**: Test parameters for testing multiple scenarios
- **Temporary Directories**: All tests use temporary directories for file operations

## Running the Tests

We've created a convenient test runner script (`run_tests.py`) that allows for:

- Running all tests: `./run_tests.py`
- Running only unit tests: `./run_tests.py --unit`
- Running only integration tests: `./run_tests.py --integration`
- Generating coverage reports: `./run_tests.py --coverage`
- Testing specific components: `./run_tests.py --pattern test_chunker`

## Test Dependencies

The test suite requires the following additional dependencies:
- pytest
- pytest-cov
- pytest-mock

## Code Coverage

The test suite aims to achieve:
- 90%+ line coverage for core components
- 80%+ branch coverage
- 100% coverage for critical code paths

## Future Test Improvements

- Add property-based testing for chunking strategies
- Expand integration tests with realistic codebases
- Add load testing for vector store operations
- Implement end-to-end tests with actual API calls (behind feature flags)
- Add CI integration for automated test runs on commits
