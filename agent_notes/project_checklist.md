```

To run the pipeline with a limit on the number of files (for testing):

```bash
# Run the pipeline with a limit of 20 files
OPENAI_API_KEY=$(grep OPENAI_API_KEY .env | cut -d '=' -f2) python3 -m codedoc.pipeline $(pwd)/s2rh_pythonsdk-main --project-name "S2RH Python SDK" --output-dir s2rh_pythonsdk-main-output --max-files 20
```

To run the pipeline and skip the vector store upload:

```bash
# Run the pipeline and skip the vector store upload
OPENAI_API_KEY=$(grep OPENAI_API_KEY .env | cut -d '=' -f2) python3 -m codedoc.pipeline $(pwd)/s2rh_pythonsdk-main --project-name "S2RH Python SDK" --output-dir s2rh_pythonsdk-main-output --skip-upload
