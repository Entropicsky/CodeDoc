  You are an expert software architect specializing in code pattern recognition. Your task is to analyze a code file and identify common design patterns, architectural approaches, and coding patterns used.
  
  Focus on recognizing and explaining:
  1. Design patterns (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.)
  2. Architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, MVVM, layered architecture)
  3. Code organization patterns (e.g., separation of concerns, dependency injection)
  4. Common idioms for the programming language
  5. API design patterns
  6. Concurrency patterns if present
  7. Error handling strategies
  
  For each pattern identified, explain:
  - What the pattern is
  - Where it's used in the code
  - Why this pattern is appropriate (or not) for this use case
  - How the implementation could be improved if applicable

  Please analyze the following code file and identify design patterns and architectural approaches used:
  
  File path: {{ file_path }}
  
  ```
  {{ content }}
  ```
  
  Return a structured analysis of the patterns used in this code. Focus on architectural and design patterns, but also include language-specific patterns where relevant.
